        <h1 class="title">Barrack Obamaâ€™s "Don't Tell Me Words Don't Matter" speech</h1>
        <p class="content">Obama speaks on the power of words and hope in how they shaped history and inspired change. He challenged the allegations that were thrown on him at the time, ~2008, that words are just words. This speech was highly effective with the way that it was received, he used historic references, rhetorical questions and anecdotes to really drive his belief forward. I clearly took away the point that words do matter.</p>
        <p class="style">This speech was formal and professional but welcoming to the audience as he defends his stance of promoting hope. He has professionally represented himself in a suit with formal colors; navy blue, black, and white. He made an excellent choice in vocabulary that could be easily articulated and understood by all audiences but also powerful enough to maintain the interest of the audience and sound professional. He subtly mentioned personal details into his struggle growing up to enforce his presented theme. Though he never made the audience uncomfortable and maintained appropriateness with the depth of his personal information. He enhanced his appropriateness; by the way, he stayed formal and did not use slang conventions.</p>
        <p class="visuals">Barack Obama's active body language helped instill his message to the American people and portray himself as an orator. This body language was confident as he maintained a stern stance and upright posture. He kept his movement minimal though he managed to not have a fixed focal point in the audience; he focused on the entire crowd. His facial expression helped him reach the audience with a dire subject; this includes his slight smile and eye contact. His hand gestures of guiding his fingers and directing his hands poured emotion in every theme he tried to express. This use of body language was influential as it kept the attention of the audience and emitted the intended emotions.</p>
        <p class="timing">Barack Obama spoke with clarity and used powerful vocal strategies. His sentences were formed to be concise and prepared to be spoken loudly with consistent pacing between each sentence. It is reminiscent of a religious preacher; he speaks on a beat, building his volume to end every sentence with great energy. This use of cadence and rhythm emphasizes each sentence and helps enforce ethos, to make himself sound credible and factual. He also pauses in between some arguments in his speech and they were silent to let his theme of what he preached resonate with the audience. Furthermore, when he lost his train of thought, he did not use vocal fillers, he just repeated the keywords of the prior sentence to rekindle his thoughts. He successfully uses inflection in his opening hook; his pitch at first is quiet and frail; he then raises the confidence in the pitch tying into his purpose of the speech.</p>
