        <p>The visuals in the advertisement are orchestrated to create a story that links greatness in sports with the Gatorade. The athlete, Micheal Jordan, has a sense of exceptional ability and vitality. This image of athletic excellence is juxtaposed with the brightly colored sports. The phrase "BE LIKE MIKE” is a direct command, a catchy rhyme, and a play on the aspirational desire to emulate one of the greatest to ever play the game of basketball! 
The ad suggests that consuming the same product as the depicted athlete might allow one to acquire a piece of Mike’s skill. It doesn't just sell a beverage; it sells an ideal, a dream of athleticism 
The overall composition utilizes the Gestalt principle of closure, where one’s mind completes the connection between the athletic image and the product. The ad relies on the viewer's existing knowledge of the Mike’s legacy. Which makes them to fill in the gaps and make the leap that by choosing this sports drink, they're choosing to align with his basketball greatness.
